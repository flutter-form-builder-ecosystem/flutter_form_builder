Flutter Form Builder provides an easy way of working with forms in Flutter by removing the boilerplate needed to build a form, validate fields, react to changes, and collect final user input.

FormBuilder helps in creation of data collection forms in Flutter by removing the boilerplate needed to build a form, validate fields, react to changes,
and collect final user input.
It provides APIs to manage your Form and generating a FormBuilder compliant FormField. It is required by `form_builder_extra_fields` packages.
This package also contains common ready-made form input fields. The package gives you a convenient way of adding fields instead of creating your own FormBuilderField from scratch.

Form Builder Fields provides ready-made form input fields. Just like the flutter_form_builder package, it gives you a convenient way of adding fields instead of creating your own FormBuilderField from scratch.

Unlike flutter_form_builder package which depends purely on Flutter provided input fields, flutter_extra_fields depends on external libraries to provide input widgets and extends them to be FormBuilderFields.
